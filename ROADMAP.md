### Planned Features
- [ ] Implement advanced routing features (e.g., route parameters, query parameters)
- [ ] Improve Performance: Optimize the framework for better performance and lower latency
- [ ] Implement Caching: Add support for caching responses to improve performance
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement A State Managment Solution
- [ ] Add support for WebSockets


### Improvements
- [ ] Optimize performance for high-concurrency scenarios
- [ ] Refactor codebase for better maintainability and readability
- [ ] Expand documentation with more examples and use cases
- [ ] Enhance testing framework with more comprehensive test coverage

### Developer's Notes
- Question: Should Feather use Async/Await or stick with the current Sync/Threads API?
