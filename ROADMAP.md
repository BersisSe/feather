# Feather Framework Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the Feather framework.

### Planned Features
- [ ] Implement advanced routing features (e.g., route parameters, query parameters)
- [ ] Add support for static file serving
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging
- [ ] Add A Writable/Readable stores for session management(Kinda like svelte stores)
- [ ] Add support for WebSockets
- [ ] Add Templating support(tera, handlebars, etc)

### Improvements
- [ ] Optimize performance for high-concurrency scenarios
- [ ] Refactor codebase for better maintainability and readability
- [ ] Expand documentation with more examples and use cases
- [ ] Enhance testing framework with more comprehensive test coverage

### Developer's Notes
- Question: Should Feather use Async/Await or stick with the current Sync/Threads API?
