# Feather

Feather is a lightweight, flexible, and highly extensible web framework for Rust, inspired by the simplicity and modularity of Express.js.

---

## Features

- **Middleware Support**: Chain and compose middleware functions effortlessly.
- **Route Handling**: Support for multiple HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).
- **Lightweight**: Built using Rustâ€™s high-performance and memory-safe features.
- **Thread-Safe**: Leverages Rust's thread safe aspects.

## Modules

- `middleware`: Contains the middleware trait and related functionality
- `types`: Defines common types used throughout the framework
- `sync`: Contains the main application and configuration structs

## Re-exports

The following items are re-exported for convenience:

- `AppConfig`: Configuration settings for the application
- `Middleware`: Trait for defining middleware
- `Response`: Type for HTTP responses
- `Request`: Type for HTTP requests
- `App`: The main application struct
- `Next`: Type alias for the next middleware function

---

## Installation

To get started with Feather, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = "0.1.1"
```

## Quick Start

Here's an example of building a simple web server with Feather:

```rust
//*Import Dependencies from Feather
use feather::{App, AppConfig};
use feather::Response;
use feather::middleware::Logger;
//*Main Function No Async Here
fn main() {
    //*Create instance of AppConfig with 4 threads
    let config = AppConfig { threads: 4 };

    //*Create a new instance of App
    let mut app = App::new(config);

    //*Define a route for the root path
    app.get("/", |_req| {
        Response::ok("Hello From Feather")
    });
    //*Use the Logger middleware
    app.use_middleware(Logger);
    //*Listen on port 3000
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:3000");
}

```

---

## Middleware

Feather supports middleware for pre-processing requests and post-processing responses. Here's an example:

```rust
//* Import Dependencies from Feather
use feather::{App, AppConfig};
use feather::Response;
use feather::middleware::Logger;
//* Main Function No Async Here
fn main() {
    //* Create instance of AppConfig with 4 threads
    let config = AppConfig { threads: 4 };

    //* Create a new instance of App
    let mut app = App::new(config);

    //* Define a route for the root path
    app.get("/", |_req| {
        Response::ok("Hello From Feather")
    });
    //* Use the Logger middleware
    app.use_middleware(Logger);
    //* Listen on port 3000
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:3000");
}
```

Built-in middleware includes:

- `Logger`: Logs incoming requests.
- `Cors`: Add cross-origin resource sharing headers to your response.

## Goals

- Be the simple & beginner-friendly web framework for Rust
- Be modular and expandable by design
- Be easy to use and learn

## Non-Goals

- Be the most powerful/performant web framework
- Use complex and low-level features
- Be the most feature-rich web framework
