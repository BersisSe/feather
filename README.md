# 🪶 Feather

**Feather** is a lightweight, DX-first web framework for Rust — inspired by the simplicity of Express.js, but designed for Rust’s performance and safety.
---

## Why Feather?

- **Middleware-First Architecture**  
  Everything is a middleware — route handlers, auth, logging, error handling — all composable and clean.

- **Lightweight and Fast**  
  Feather uses traditional threads instead of async, avoiding the overhead and complexity of Rust’s async model.

- **Easy State Management Using Context**  
  In the recent version Feather implemented the Context API that allows it have easy state managment without the use of Extractors/Macros 

- **Developer Experience First**  
  Feather’s API is minimal, ergonomic, and readable — no lifetimes, no `.await`, 

- **Modular and Extensible**  
  Build the framework you want with plug-and-play middleware, simple traits, and clear primitives.

- **Great Tooling Out Of the Box**  
  With the use of the [Feather-CLI](https://github.com/BersisSe/feather-cli/tree/main) Creating API's and Web Servers Become a Breeze.

## Getting Started

Add Feather to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = "0.3.1"
```

---

## Quick Example

```rust,no_run
use feather::{App, AppContext, MiddlewareResult,Request, Response};

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.get("/",|_req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext| {
            res.send_text("Hello, world!");
            MiddlewareResult::Next
    });

    app.listen("127.0.0.1:3000");
}

```

That’s all — no async, no magic.

---

## Middleware in Feather

Middleware is the heart of Feather. Write it as a closure, a struct, or chain them together:

```rust,no_run
use feather::{App, AppContext, Request, Response};
use feather::middleware::builtins;
use feather::middleware::{Middleware, MiddlewareResult};
// Implementors of the Middleware trait are middleware that can be used in a Feather app.
struct Custom;
impl Middleware for Custom {
    fn handle(&self,request: &mut Request,_response: &mut Response,_ctx: &mut AppContex) -> MiddlewareResult {
      println!("Now running some custom middleware (struct Custom)!");
      println!("And there's a request with path: {:?}", request.uri);
      MiddlewareResult::Next
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.use_middleware(builtins::Logger);
    app.use_middleware(Custom);
    app.use_middleware(|_req: &mut Request, _res: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext| {
        println!("Now running some custom middleware (closure)!");
        MiddlewareResult::Next
    });

    app.get("/",|_req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext| {
        res.send_text("Hello, world!");
        MiddlewareResult::Next
    });

    app.listen("127.0.0.1:3000");
}
```
---
## State Management using the Context API
Feather's new Context API allows you to manage application-wide state without extractors or macros. Here's an example:
```rust,no_run
use feather::{App, AppContext, MiddlewareResult, Response, Request};

struct Counter {
    pub count: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    let counter = Counter { count: 0 };
    app.context().set_state(counter);

    app.get("/", move |_req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response, ctx: &mut AppContext| {
        let counter: &mut Counter = ctx.get_mut_state::<Counter>().unwrap();
        counter.count += 1;
        res.send_text(format!("Counted! {}", counter.count));
        MiddlewareResult::Next
    });
    app.get("/count", move |_req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response, ctx: &mut AppContext| {
        let counter = ctx.get_state::<Counter>().unwrap();
        res.send_text(counter.count.to_string());
        MiddlewareResult::Next
    });

    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```
Context Is more useful when combined with Database/File Accesses 

## Built-in JWT Authentication

Feather has native JWT middleware activated using a cargo feature `jwt`:
```toml
[dependencies]
feather = { version = "0.3.1", features = ["jwt"] }
```

```rust,no_run
use feather::jwt::{generate_jwt, with_jwt_auth};
use feather::{App, AppContext};

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.get("/auth",with_jwt_auth("secretcode", |_req, res,_ctx, claim| {
        println!("Claim: {:?}", claim);
        res.send_text("Hello, JWT!");
        feather::MiddlewareResult::Next
      }),
    );
    // Check the JWT Example for more complete version!
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080")
}
```
