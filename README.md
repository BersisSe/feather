## **Feather** is a lightweight, DX-first web framework for Rust. Inspired by the simplicity of Express.js, but designed for Rust‚Äôs performance and safety.

## Why Feather?

- **Middleware-First Architecture**  
  Everything is a middleware‚Äîeven if it's not, it produces a middleware in the end.  
  The new `middleware!` macro makes writing route and middleware closures concise and ergonomic.

- **Easy State Management Using Context**  
  The Context API makes it very easy to manage state without the use of Extractors/Macros.  

- **All in One**  
  Feather is a complete web framework that includes routing, middleware, logging, JWT authentication, and more, all in one package.

- **Feel of Async Without Async**  
  Feather is multithreaded by default, running on **Feather-Runtime**.
  



## How it works behind the scenes

Feather is powered by **Feather-Runtime**, a custom runtime built for high concurrency and low latency without using Rust's async/await. Each request is handled by a lightweight coroutine, enabling thousands of concurrent connections with simple, synchronous code. For more technical details, see [Feather-Runtime](./crates/feather-runtime).

---

## Getting Started

Add Feather to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = "~0.5"
```

---

## Quick Example


```rust
use feather::{App, middleware_fn};

#[middleware_fn]
fn hello() -> feather::Outcome {
    res.send_text("Hello, world!");
    next!()
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.get("/", hello);
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

That‚Äôs all ‚Äî no async.

---

## Middleware in Feather

Middleware is the heart of Feather. You may write it as a closure (using the `middleware!` macro), a struct, or chain them together:


```rust
use feather::{App, middleware_fn};

#[middleware_fn]
fn log_middleware() -> feather::Outcome {
    println!("Custom global middleware!");
    next!()
}

#[middleware_fn]
fn hello() -> feather::Outcome {
    res.send_text("Hello, world!");
    next!()
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.use_middleware(log_middleware);
    app.get("/", hello);
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

Or as a struct:


```rust
use feather::{middleware_fn, Request, Response, AppContext, Middleware, next, info};

struct CustomMiddleware;

impl Middleware for CustomMiddleware {
    fn handle(&self, _request: &mut Request, _response: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext) -> feather::Outcome {
        info!("Hii I am a Struct Middleware and this is my data: {}", self.0);
        next!()
    }
}


```

## State Management using the Context API

Feather's Context API allows you to manage application-wide state without extractors or macros.


```rust
use feather::{App, middleware_fn};
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Counter { pub count: i32 }

#[middleware_fn]
fn count() -> feather::Outcome {
    let counter = ctx.get_mut_state::<Counter>().unwrap();
    counter.count += 1;
    res.send_text(format!("Counted! {}", counter.count));
    next!()
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.context().set_state(Counter { count: 0 });
    app.get("/", count);
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

Context is especially useful when needing to access databases and files.

## Built-in JWT Authentication

Feather has a native JWT module activated using a cargo feature `jwt`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = { version = "*", features = ["jwt"] }
```


```rust
use feather::{App, jwt_required, middleware_fn};
use feather::jwt::{JwtManager, SimpleClaims};

#[middleware_fn]
fn token_route() -> feather::Outcome {
    let token = ctx.jwt().generate_simple("user", 1)?;
    res.send_text(format!("Token: {}", token));
    next!()
}

#[jwt_required]
#[middleware_fn]
fn protected(claims: SimpleClaims) -> feather::Outcome {
    res.send_text(format!("Hello, {}!", claims.sub));
    next!()
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    let manager = JwtManager::new("secretcode");
    app.context().set_jwt(manager);
    app.get("/token", token_route);
    app.get("/auth", protected);
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080");
}
```
---

## Logging
When you create a new Feather application, it initializes the logger by default.


```rust
fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    info!("Feather app ready to serve requests!");
    // Your app setup here
    app.listen("127.0.1:5050");
    
}
```
if you don't want it to be initialized, you can disable it by create a App with `without_logger` method

```rust
