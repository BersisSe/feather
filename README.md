# Feather

Feather is a lightweight, flexible, and highly extensible web framework for Rust, inspired by the simplicity and modularity of Express.js.

---

## Features

- **Middleware Support**: Chain and compose middleware functions effortlessly.
- **Route Handling**: Support for multiple HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).
- **Lightweight**: Built using Rustâ€™s high-performance and memory-safe features.
- **Thread-Safe**: Leverages Rust's Thread Safe Aspects.

## Installation

To get started with Feather, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = "0.0.1"
```

## Quick Start

Here's an example of building a simple web server with Feather:

```rust
use feather::types::Response;
use feather::sync::App;

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();

    // Add a GET route
    app.get("/", |req| {
        Response::ok("Welcome to Feather!")
    });

    // Add a POST route
    app.post("/data", |req| {
        let mut body = String::new();
        if let Ok(res) = req.as_reader().read_to_string(&mut body){
            Response::ok(format!("Received Body: {}", res))
        }else {
            Response::new(400, "Bad Request")
        }
    });

    // Listen on localhost:8080
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080");
}
```

## Middleware

Feather supports middleware for pre-processing requests and post-processing responses. Here's an example:

```rust
use feather::sync::App;

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();

    // Add a logging middleware
    app.use_middleware(Middleware::new(|req, next| {
        println!("Incoming request: {} {}", req.method(), req.url());
        next(req)
    }));

    app.get("/", |req| Response::ok("Hello, Feather!"));

    app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080");
}
```

Built-in middleware includes:
- `logger`: Logs incoming Requests
- `parse_json`: Parses incoming JSON requests.
- `serve_static`(WIP): Serves static files from a specified directory.

---
## Goals
- Be the simplest Web Framework for Rust
- Support Sync and Async Programing Paradigms

## Non-Goals
- Be the most powerful/performant Web Framework
- Use Complex and Low-level features

---
## Planned Features
- Full Featured async support with Tokio
- More builtin middlewares
- Ctrl-C Gracefull Shutdown
---
