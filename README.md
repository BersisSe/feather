## **Feather** is a lightweight, DX-first web framework for Rust. Inspired by the simplicity of Express.js, but designed for Rust‚Äôs performance and safety.

## Why Feather?

- **Middleware-First Architecture**  
  Everything is a middleware‚Äîeven if it's not, it produces a middleware in the end.  
  The new `middleware!` macro makes writing route and middleware closures concise and ergonomic.

- **Easy State Management Using Context**  
  The Context API makes it very easy to manage state without the use of Extractors/Macros.  

- **All in One**  
  Feather is a complete web framework that includes routing, middleware, logging, JWT authentication, and more, all in one package.

- **Feel of Async Without Async**  
  Feather is multithreaded by default, running on **Feather-Runtime**.
  

## How it works behind the scenes:  
Every request is given a thread from the server's threadpool and that thread is responsible for returning the response to that request.  
So you can run long running tasks on another thread in the middlewares, but the response can only be returned from the middleware the request is accepted on.  
If you want to go deeper take a look at [Feather-Runtime](./crates/feather-runtime)  

---

## Getting Started

Add Feather to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = "~0.4"
```

---

## Quick Example

```rust
use feather::middlewares::builtins;
use feather::{App, next, middleware};
fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.get("/", middleware!(|_req, res, _ctx| {
        res.send_text("Hello, world!");
        next!()
    }));
    app.use_middleware(builtins::Logger);
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

That‚Äôs all ‚Äî no async.

## Middleware in Feather

Middleware is the heart of Feather. You may write it as a closure (using the `middleware!` macro), a struct, or chain them together:

```rust
use feather::{App, next, middleware};

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.use_middleware(middleware!(|_req, _res, _ctx| {
        println!("Custom global middleware!");
        next!()
    }));
    app.get("/", middleware!(|_req, res, _ctx| {
        res.send_text("Hello, world!");
        next!()
    }));
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

Or as a struct:

```rust
use feather::{middlewares::Middleware, next};
struct Custom;
impl Middleware for Custom {
    fn handle(&self, req: &mut feather::Request, res: &mut feather::Response, ctx: &mut feather::AppContext) -> feather::Outcome {
        println!("Custom struct middleware!");
        next!()
    }
}
```

---

## State Management using the Context API

Feather's Context API allows you to manage application-wide state without extractors or macros.

```rust
use feather::{next, App, middleware};
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Counter { pub count: i32 }
fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.context().set_state(Counter { count: 0 });
    app.get("/", middleware!(|_req, res, ctx| {
        let counter = ctx.get_mut_state::<Counter>().unwrap();
        counter.count += 1;
        res.send_text(format!("Counted! {}", counter.count));
        next!()
    }));
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

Context is especially useful when needing to access databases and files.

## Built-in JWT Authentication

Feather has a native JWT module activated using a cargo feature `jwt`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = { version = "*", features = ["jwt"] }
```

```rust
use feather::jwt::{generate_jwt, with_jwt_auth};
use feather::{App, next};
fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.get("/auth", with_jwt_auth("secretcode", |_req, res, _ctx, claim| {
        println!("Claim: {:?}", claim);
        res.send_text("Hello, JWT!");
        next!()
    }));
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080")
}
```
