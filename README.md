# ü™∂ Feather Web Socket Branch
# Current State: Non Working

### Web Socket Feature branch Still Very experimantal!


## Why Feather?

- **Middleware-First Architecture**  
  Everything is a middleware ‚Äî route handlers, auth, logging ‚Äî all composable and clean

- **Easy State Management Using Context**  
  Recently implemented the Context API that makes it very easy to manage state without the use of Extractors/Macros

- **Developer Experience First**  
  Feather‚Äôs API is minimal, ergonomic, and readable

- **Modular and Extensible**  
  Feather is designed to be Modular. Select only the features you need and use. What you don't use you don't pay for.

- **Great Tooling Out Of the Box**  
  With the use of the [Feather-CLI](https://github.com/BersisSe/feather-cli/tree/main) creating API's and Web Servers becomes a _Breeze_.

## Getting Started

Add Feather to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = "0.4.1"
```

---

## Quick Example

```rust,no_run
use feather::middleware::builtins;
use feather::{App, AppContext, next};
use feather::{Request, Response};
fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.get("/", |_request: &mut Request, response: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext| {
        response.send_text("Hello, world!");
        next!()
    });
    
    app.use_middleware(builtins::Logger);
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

That‚Äôs all ‚Äî no async.

## Middleware in Feather

Middleware is intented to be the heart of Feather. You may write it as a closure, a struct, or chain them together:

```rust,no_run
use feather::{App, AppContext, Request, Response,next,Outcome};
use feather::middleware::builtins;
use feather::middleware::{Middleware, MiddlewareResult};

// Implementors of the Middleware trait are middleware that can be used in a Feather app.
struct Custom;

impl Middleware for Custom {
    fn handle(&self, request: &mut Request, _response: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext) -> Outcome {
      println!("Now running some custom middleware (struct Custom)!");
      println!("And there's a request with path: {:?}", request.uri);
      next!()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.use_middleware(builtins::Logger);
    app.use_middleware(Custom);
    app.use_middleware(|_req: &mut Request, _res: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext| {
        println!("Now running some custom middleware (closure)!");
        next!()
    });

    app.get("/",|_req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response, _ctx: &mut AppContext| {
        res.send_text("Hello, world!");
        next!()
    });

    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}
```

## State Management using the Context API

Feather's new Context API allows you to manage application-wide state without extractors or macros.

As an example:

```rust,no_run
use feather::{next, App, AppContext, Request, Response};
// Create a couter struct to hold the state
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Counter {
    pub count: i32,
}
fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    let counter = Counter { count: 0 };
    app.context().set_state(counter);

    app.get("/",move |_req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response, ctx: &mut AppContext| {
      let counter: &mut Counter = ctx.get_mut_state::<Counter>().unwrap();
      counter.count += 1;
      res.send_text(format!("Counted! {}", counter.count));
      next!()
    });
    // Lastly add a route to get the current count
    app.get("/count",move |_req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response, ctx: &mut AppContext| {
      let counter = ctx.get_state::<Counter>().unwrap();
      res.send_text(counter.count.to_string());
      next!()
    });
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:5050");
}

```

Context is especially useful when needing to access databases and files.

## Built-in JWT Authentication

Feather has a native JWT module activated using a cargo feature `jwt`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = { version = "0.3.1", features = ["jwt"] }
```

```rust,no_run
use feather::jwt::{generate_jwt, with_jwt_auth};
use feather::{App, AppContext,next};

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.get("/auth",with_jwt_auth("secretcode", |_req, res,_ctx, claim| {
        println!("Claim: {:?}", claim);
        res.send_text("Hello, JWT!");
        next!()
      }),
    );
    // Check the JWT Example for a more complete version!
    app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080")
}
```

## Goals

- Being the simplest Rust web framework to get started with
- Being modular and easy to extend
- Focusing on DX without sacrificing Rust's safety and performance
